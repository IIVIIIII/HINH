A House is Not a Home is a fashion collection by designer Sam Fissell that I was commissioned to do a sound piece for. This repository details the compositional techniques and strategies used in my contribution to this project, as well as the conceptual frameworks which guides them.

"A House is Not a Home, Inspired by Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, the story of an adventurer who journeyed to remote regions of the world. If, as Swift said, words are the clothing of our thoughts, the places we have lived are the fabric of our selves. The day to day experiences of living in different places have clothed and re-clothed me. This collection creates gestures of these places' essences, not in a literal way, but like painting a shadow of a building. My intent is not to depict the building but the memory of it, the impression of a building."


Act I lingers on a performance of Cambodian court musicians- slowly scanning back and forth over the audio as though reminiscing over a memory. The resulting audio acts as the foundation for the entire piece.

Act II uses a python script to automatically synchronize notes with the steps of the models. In doing so, the progession of the piece is directly tied to travel in a literal sense.

A sampler was created for Act III to simulate random walking paces within a set range. This allowed for a composition before actually knowing what the step times would be. It also served as a way to test what general tempos would be best for the models to walk at. Act III conveys the multiplicity of the singular self after having been redefined many times through travel. These selves begin as distinct from each other but gradually expand and overlap until they are indistinguishable.
