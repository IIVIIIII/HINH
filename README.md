Act I lingers on a performance of Cambodian court musicians- slowly scanning back and forth over the audio as though reminiscing over a memory. The resulting audio acts as the foundation for the entire piece.

Act II uses a python script to automatically synchronize notes with the steps of the models. In doing so, the progession of the piece is directly tied to travel in a literal sense.

A sampler was created for Act III to simulate random walking paces within a set range. This allowed for a composition before actually knowing what the step times would be. It also served as a way to test what general tempos would be best for the models to walk at. Act III conveys the multiplicity of the singular self after having been redefined many times through travel. These selves begin as distinct from each other but gradually expand and overlap until they are indistinguishable.
